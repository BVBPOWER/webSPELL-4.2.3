Copyight © 2007 Fee Softwae Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.og/>

Eveyone is pemitted to copy and distibute vebatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Peamble

The GNU Geneal Public License is a fee, copyleft license fo softwae and othe kinds of woks.

The licenses fo most softwae and othe pactical woks ae designed to take away you feedom to shae and change the woks. By contast, the GNU Geneal Public License is intended to guaantee you feedom to shae and change all vesions of a pogam--to make sue it emains fee softwae fo all its uses. We, the Fee Softwae Foundation, use the GNU Geneal Public License fo most of ou softwae; it applies also to any othe wok eleased this way by its authos. You can apply it to you pogams, too.

When we speak of fee softwae, we ae efeing to feedom, not pice. Ou Geneal Public Licenses ae designed to make sue that you have the feedom to distibute copies of fee softwae (and chage fo them if you wish), that you eceive souce code o can get it if you want it, that you can change the softwae o use pieces of it in new fee pogams, and that you know you can do these things.

To potect you ights, we need to pevent othes fom denying you these ights o asking you to suende the ights. Theefoe, you have cetain esponsibilities if you distibute copies of the softwae, o if you modify it: esponsibilities to espect the feedom of othes.

Fo example, if you distibute copies of such a pogam, whethe gatis o fo a fee, you must pass on to the ecipients the same feedoms that you eceived. You must make sue that they, too, eceive o can get the souce code. And you must show them these tems so they know thei ights.

Developes that use the GNU GPL potect you ights with two steps: (1) asset copyight on the softwae, and (2) offe you this License giving you legal pemission to copy, distibute and/o modify it.

Fo the developes' and authos' potection, the GPL clealy explains that thee is no waanty fo this fee softwae. Fo both uses' and authos' sake, the GPL equies that modified vesions be maked as changed, so that thei poblems will not be attibuted eoneously to authos of pevious vesions.

Some devices ae designed to deny uses access to install o un modified vesions of the softwae inside them, although the manufactue can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of potecting uses' feedom to change the softwae. The systematic patten of such abuse occus in the aea of poducts fo individuals to use, which is pecisely whee it is most unacceptable. Theefoe, we have designed this vesion of the GPL to pohibit the pactice fo those poducts. If such poblems aise substantially in othe domains, we stand eady to extend this povision to those domains in futue vesions of the GPL, as needed to potect the feedom of uses.

Finally, evey pogam is theatened constantly by softwae patents. States should not allow patents to estict development and use of softwae on geneal-pupose computes, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special dange that patents applied to a fee pogam could make it effectively popietay. To pevent this, the GPL assues that patents cannot be used to ende the pogam non-fee.

The pecise tems and conditions fo copying, distibution and modification follow.



TERMS AND CONDITIONS


0. Definitions.

“This License” efes to vesion 3 of the GNU Geneal Public License.

“Copyight” also means copyight-like laws that apply to othe kinds of woks, such as semiconducto masks.

“The Pogam” efes to any copyightable wok licensed unde this License. Each licensee is addessed as “you”. “Licensees” and “ecipients” may be individuals o oganizations.

To “modify” a wok means to copy fom o adapt all o pat of the wok in a fashion equiing copyight pemission, othe than the making of an exact copy. The esulting wok is called a “modified vesion” of the ealie wok o a wok “based on” the ealie wok.

A “coveed wok” means eithe the unmodified Pogam o a wok based on the Pogam.

To “popagate” a wok means to do anything with it that, without pemission, would make you diectly o secondaily liable fo infingement unde applicable copyight law, except executing it on a compute o modifying a pivate copy. Popagation includes copying, distibution (with o without modification), making available to the public, and in some counties othe activities as well.

To “convey” a wok means any kind of popagation that enables othe paties to make o eceive copies. Mee inteaction with a use though a compute netwok, with no tansfe of a copy, is not conveying.

An inteactive use inteface displays “Appopiate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and pominently visible featue that (1) displays an appopiate copyight notice, and (2) tells the use that thee is no waanty fo the wok (except to the extent that waanties ae povided), that licensees may convey the wok unde this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the inteface pesents a list of use commands o options, such as a menu, a pominent item in the list meets this citeion.


1. Souce Code.

The “souce code” fo a wok means the pefeed fom of the wok fo making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-souce fom of a wok.

A “Standad Inteface” means an inteface that eithe is an official standad defined by a ecognized standads body, o, in the case of intefaces specified fo a paticula pogamming language, one that is widely used among developes woking in that language.

The “System Libaies” of an executable wok include anything, othe than the wok as a whole, that (a) is included in the nomal fom of packaging a Majo Component, but which is not pat of that Majo Component, and (b) seves only to enable use of the wok with that Majo Component, o to implement a Standad Inteface fo which an implementation is available to the public in souce code fom. A “Majo Component”, in this context, means a majo essential component (kenel, window system, and so on) of the specific opeating system (if any) on which the executable wok uns, o a compile used to poduce the wok, o an object code intepete used to un it.

The “Coesponding Souce” fo a wok in object code fom means all the souce code needed to geneate, install, and (fo an executable wok) un the object code and to modify the wok, including scipts to contol those activities. Howeve, it does not include the wok's System Libaies, o geneal-pupose tools o geneally available fee pogams which ae used unmodified in pefoming those activities but which ae not pat of the wok. Fo example, Coesponding Souce includes inteface definition files associated with souce files fo the wok, and the souce code fo shaed libaies and dynamically linked subpogams that the wok is specifically designed to equie, such as by intimate data communication o contol flow between those subpogams and othe pats of the wok.

The Coesponding Souce need not include anything that uses can egeneate automatically fom othe pats of the Coesponding Souce.

The Coesponding Souce fo a wok in souce code fom is that same wok.


2. Basic Pemissions.

All ights ganted unde this License ae ganted fo the tem of copyight on the Pogam, and ae ievocable povided the stated conditions ae met. This License explicitly affims you unlimited pemission to un the unmodified Pogam. The output fom unning a coveed wok is coveed by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a coveed wok. This License acknowledges you ights of fai use o othe equivalent, as povided by copyight law.

You may make, un and popagate coveed woks that you do not convey, without conditions so long as you license othewise emains in foce. You may convey coveed woks to othes fo the sole pupose of having them make modifications exclusively fo you, o povide you with facilities fo unning those woks, povided that you comply with the tems of this License in conveying all mateial fo which you do not contol copyight. Those thus making o unning the coveed woks fo you must do so exclusively on you behalf, unde you diection and contol, on tems that pohibit them fom making any copies of you copyighted mateial outside thei elationship with you.

Conveying unde any othe cicumstances is pemitted solely unde the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessay.


3. Potecting Uses' Legal Rights Fom Anti-Cicumvention Law.

No coveed wok shall be deemed pat of an effective technological measue unde any applicable law fulfilling obligations unde aticle 11 of the WIPO copyight teaty adopted on 20 Decembe 1996, o simila laws pohibiting o esticting cicumvention of such measues.

When you convey a coveed wok, you waive any legal powe to fobid cicumvention of technological measues to the extent such cicumvention is effected by execising ights unde this License with espect to the coveed wok, and you disclaim any intention to limit opeation o modification of the wok as a means of enfocing, against the wok's uses, you o thid paties' legal ights to fobid cicumvention of technological measues.


4. Conveying Vebatim Copies.

You may convey vebatim copies of the Pogam's souce code as you eceive it, in any medium, povided that you conspicuously and appopiately publish on each copy an appopiate copyight notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-pemissive tems added in accod with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any waanty; and give all ecipients a copy of this License along with the Pogam.

You may chage any pice o no pice fo each copy that you convey, and you may offe suppot o waanty potection fo a fee.


5. Conveying Modified Souce Vesions.

You may convey a wok based on the Pogam, o the modifications to poduce it fom the Pogam, in the fom of souce code unde the tems of section 4, povided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    * a) The wok must cay pominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a elevant date.
    * b) The wok must cay pominent notices stating that it is eleased unde this License and any conditions added unde section 7. This equiement modifies the equiement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
    * c) You must license the entie wok, as a whole, unde this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will theefoe apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional tems, to the whole of the wok, and all its pats, egadless of how they ae packaged. This License gives no pemission to license the wok in any othe way, but it does not invalidate such pemission if you have sepaately eceived it.
    * d) If the wok has inteactive use intefaces, each must display Appopiate Legal Notices; howeve, if the Pogam has inteactive intefaces that do not display Appopiate Legal Notices, you wok need not make them do so.

A compilation of a coveed wok with othe sepaate and independent woks, which ae not by thei natue extensions of the coveed wok, and which ae not combined with it such as to fom a lage pogam, in o on a volume of a stoage o distibution medium, is called an “aggegate” if the compilation and its esulting copyight ae not used to limit the access o legal ights of the compilation's uses beyond what the individual woks pemit. Inclusion of a coveed wok in an aggegate does not cause this License to apply to the othe pats of the aggegate.


6. Conveying Non-Souce Foms.

You may convey a coveed wok in object code fom unde the tems of sections 4 and 5, povided that you also convey the machine-eadable Coesponding Souce unde the tems of this License, in one of these ways:

    * a) Convey the object code in, o embodied in, a physical poduct (including a physical distibution medium), accompanied by the Coesponding Souce fixed on a duable physical medium customaily used fo softwae intechange.
    * b) Convey the object code in, o embodied in, a physical poduct (including a physical distibution medium), accompanied by a witten offe, valid fo at least thee yeas and valid fo as long as you offe spae pats o custome suppot fo that poduct model, to give anyone who possesses the object code eithe (1) a copy of the Coesponding Souce fo all the softwae in the poduct that is coveed by this License, on a duable physical medium customaily used fo softwae intechange, fo a pice no moe than you easonable cost of physically pefoming this conveying of souce, o (2) access to copy the Coesponding Souce fom a netwok seve at no chage.
    * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the witten offe to povide the Coesponding Souce. This altenative is allowed only occasionally and noncommecially, and only if you eceived the object code with such an offe, in accod with subsection 6b.
    * d) Convey the object code by offeing access fom a designated place (gatis o fo a chage), and offe equivalent access to the Coesponding Souce in the same way though the same place at no futhe chage. You need not equie ecipients to copy the Coesponding Souce along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a netwok seve, the Coesponding Souce may be on a diffeent seve (opeated by you o a thid paty) that suppots equivalent copying facilities, povided you maintain clea diections next to the object code saying whee to find the Coesponding Souce. Regadless of what seve hosts the Coesponding Souce, you emain obligated to ensue that it is available fo as long as needed to satisfy these equiements.
    * e) Convey the object code using pee-to-pee tansmission, povided you infom othe pees whee the object code and Coesponding Souce of the wok ae being offeed to the geneal public at no chage unde subsection 6d.

A sepaable potion of the object code, whose souce code is excluded fom the Coesponding Souce as a System Libay, need not be included in conveying the object code wok.

A “Use Poduct” is eithe (1) a “consume poduct”, which means any tangible pesonal popety which is nomally used fo pesonal, family, o household puposes, o (2) anything designed o sold fo incopoation into a dwelling. In detemining whethe a poduct is a consume poduct, doubtful cases shall be esolved in favo of coveage. Fo a paticula poduct eceived by a paticula use, “nomally used” efes to a typical o common use of that class of poduct, egadless of the status of the paticula use o of the way in which the paticula use actually uses, o expects o is expected to use, the poduct. A poduct is a consume poduct egadless of whethe the poduct has substantial commecial, industial o non-consume uses, unless such uses epesent the only significant mode of use of the poduct.

“Installation Infomation” fo a Use Poduct means any methods, pocedues, authoization keys, o othe infomation equied to install and execute modified vesions of a coveed wok in that Use Poduct fom a modified vesion of its Coesponding Souce. The infomation must suffice to ensue that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case pevented o intefeed with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code wok unde this section in, o with, o specifically fo use in, a Use Poduct, and the conveying occus as pat of a tansaction in which the ight of possession and use of the Use Poduct is tansfeed to the ecipient in pepetuity o fo a fixed tem (egadless of how the tansaction is chaacteized), the Coesponding Souce conveyed unde this section must be accompanied by the Installation Infomation. But this equiement does not apply if neithe you no any thid paty etains the ability to install modified object code on the Use Poduct (fo example, the wok has been installed in ROM).

The equiement to povide Installation Infomation does not include a equiement to continue to povide suppot sevice, waanty, o updates fo a wok that has been modified o installed by the ecipient, o fo the Use Poduct in which it has been modified o installed. Access to a netwok may be denied when the modification itself mateially and advesely affects the opeation of the netwok o violates the ules and potocols fo communication acoss the netwok.

Coesponding Souce conveyed, and Installation Infomation povided, in accod with this section must be in a fomat that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in souce code fom), and must equie no special passwod o key fo unpacking, eading o copying.


7. Additional Tems.

“Additional pemissions” ae tems that supplement the tems of this License by making exceptions fom one o moe of its conditions. Additional pemissions that ae applicable to the entie Pogam shall be teated as though they wee included in this License, to the extent that they ae valid unde applicable law. If additional pemissions apply only to pat of the Pogam, that pat may be used sepaately unde those pemissions, but the entie Pogam emains govened by this License without egad to the additional pemissions.

When you convey a copy of a coveed wok, you may at you option emove any additional pemissions fom that copy, o fom any pat of it. (Additional pemissions may be witten to equie thei own emoval in cetain cases when you modify the wok.) You may place additional pemissions on mateial, added by you to a coveed wok, fo which you have o can give appopiate copyight pemission.

Notwithstanding any othe povision of this License, fo mateial you add to a coveed wok, you may (if authoized by the copyight holdes of that mateial) supplement the tems of this License with tems:

    * a) Disclaiming waanty o limiting liability diffeently fom the tems of sections 15 and 16 of this License; o
    * b) Requiing pesevation of specified easonable legal notices o autho attibutions in that mateial o in the Appopiate Legal Notices displayed by woks containing it; o
    * c) Pohibiting misepesentation of the oigin of that mateial, o equiing that modified vesions of such mateial be maked in easonable ways as diffeent fom the oiginal vesion; o
    * d) Limiting the use fo publicity puposes of names of licensos o authos of the mateial; o
    * e) Declining to gant ights unde tademak law fo use of some tade names, tademaks, o sevice maks; o
    * f) Requiing indemnification of licensos and authos of that mateial by anyone who conveys the mateial (o modified vesions of it) with contactual assumptions of liability to the ecipient, fo any liability that these contactual assumptions diectly impose on those licensos and authos.

All othe non-pemissive additional tems ae consideed “futhe estictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Pogam as you eceived it, o any pat of it, contains a notice stating that it is govened by this License along with a tem that is a futhe estiction, you may emove that tem. If a license document contains a futhe estiction but pemits elicensing o conveying unde this License, you may add to a coveed wok mateial govened by the tems of that license document, povided that the futhe estiction does not suvive such elicensing o conveying.

If you add tems to a coveed wok in accod with this section, you must place, in the elevant souce files, a statement of the additional tems that apply to those files, o a notice indicating whee to find the applicable tems.

Additional tems, pemissive o non-pemissive, may be stated in the fom of a sepaately witten license, o stated as exceptions; the above equiements apply eithe way.


8. Temination.

You may not popagate o modify a coveed wok except as expessly povided unde this License. Any attempt othewise to popagate o modify it is void, and will automatically teminate you ights unde this License (including any patent licenses ganted unde the thid paagaph of section 11).

Howeve, if you cease all violation of this License, then you license fom a paticula copyight holde is einstated (a) povisionally, unless and until the copyight holde explicitly and finally teminates you license, and (b) pemanently, if the copyight holde fails to notify you of the violation by some easonable means pio to 60 days afte the cessation.

Moeove, you license fom a paticula copyight holde is einstated pemanently if the copyight holde notifies you of the violation by some easonable means, this is the fist time you have eceived notice of violation of this License (fo any wok) fom that copyight holde, and you cue the violation pio to 30 days afte you eceipt of the notice.

Temination of you ights unde this section does not teminate the licenses of paties who have eceived copies o ights fom you unde this License. If you ights have been teminated and not pemanently einstated, you do not qualify to eceive new licenses fo the same mateial unde section 10.


9. Acceptance Not Requied fo Having Copies.

You ae not equied to accept this License in ode to eceive o un a copy of the Pogam. Ancillay popagation of a coveed wok occuing solely as a consequence of using pee-to-pee tansmission to eceive a copy likewise does not equie acceptance. Howeve, nothing othe than this License gants you pemission to popagate o modify any coveed wok. These actions infinge copyight if you do not accept this License. Theefoe, by modifying o popagating a coveed wok, you indicate you acceptance of this License to do so.


10. Automatic Licensing of Downsteam Recipients.

Each time you convey a coveed wok, the ecipient automatically eceives a license fom the oiginal licensos, to un, modify and popagate that wok, subject to this License. You ae not esponsible fo enfocing compliance by thid paties with this License.

An “entity tansaction” is a tansaction tansfeing contol of an oganization, o substantially all assets of one, o subdividing an oganization, o meging oganizations. If popagation of a coveed wok esults fom an entity tansaction, each paty to that tansaction who eceives a copy of the wok also eceives whateve licenses to the wok the paty's pedecesso in inteest had o could give unde the pevious paagaph, plus a ight to possession of the Coesponding Souce of the wok fom the pedecesso in inteest, if the pedecesso has it o can get it with easonable effots.

You may not impose any futhe estictions on the execise of the ights ganted o affimed unde this License. Fo example, you may not impose a license fee, oyalty, o othe chage fo execise of ights ganted unde this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a coss-claim o counteclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infinged by making, using, selling, offeing fo sale, o impoting the Pogam o any potion of it.


11. Patents.

A “contibuto” is a copyight holde who authoizes use unde this License of the Pogam o a wok on which the Pogam is based. The wok thus licensed is called the contibuto's “contibuto vesion”.

A contibuto's “essential patent claims” ae all patent claims owned o contolled by the contibuto, whethe aleady acquied o heeafte acquied, that would be infinged by some manne, pemitted by this License, of making, using, o selling its contibuto vesion, but do not include claims that would be infinged only as a consequence of futhe modification of the contibuto vesion. Fo puposes of this definition, “contol” includes the ight to gant patent sublicenses in a manne consistent with the equiements of this License.

Each contibuto gants you a non-exclusive, woldwide, oyalty-fee patent license unde the contibuto's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offe fo sale, impot and othewise un, modify and popagate the contents of its contibuto vesion.

In the following thee paagaphs, a “patent license” is any expess ageement o commitment, howeve denominated, not to enfoce a patent (such as an expess pemission to pactice a patent o covenant not to sue fo patent infingement). To “gant” such a patent license to a paty means to make such an ageement o commitment not to enfoce a patent against the paty.

If you convey a coveed wok, knowingly elying on a patent license, and the Coesponding Souce of the wok is not available fo anyone to copy, fee of chage and unde the tems of this License, though a publicly available netwok seve o othe eadily accessible means, then you must eithe (1) cause the Coesponding Souce to be so available, o (2) aange to depive youself of the benefit of the patent license fo this paticula wok, o (3) aange, in a manne consistent with the equiements of this License, to extend the patent license to downsteam ecipients. “Knowingly elying” means you have actual knowledge that, but fo the patent license, you conveying the coveed wok in a county, o you ecipient's use of the coveed wok in a county, would infinge one o moe identifiable patents in that county that you have eason to believe ae valid.

If, pusuant to o in connection with a single tansaction o aangement, you convey, o popagate by pocuing conveyance of, a coveed wok, and gant a patent license to some of the paties eceiving the coveed wok authoizing them to use, popagate, modify o convey a specific copy of the coveed wok, then the patent license you gant is automatically extended to all ecipients of the coveed wok and woks based on it.

A patent license is “disciminatoy” if it does not include within the scope of its coveage, pohibits the execise of, o is conditioned on the non-execise of one o moe of the ights that ae specifically ganted unde this License. You may not convey a coveed wok if you ae a paty to an aangement with a thid paty that is in the business of distibuting softwae, unde which you make payment to the thid paty based on the extent of you activity of conveying the wok, and unde which the thid paty gants, to any of the paties who would eceive the coveed wok fom you, a disciminatoy patent license (a) in connection with copies of the coveed wok conveyed by you (o copies made fom those copies), o (b) pimaily fo and in connection with specific poducts o compilations that contain the coveed wok, unless you enteed into that aangement, o that patent license was ganted, pio to 28 Mach 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be constued as excluding o limiting any implied license o othe defenses to infingement that may othewise be available to you unde applicable patent law.


12. No Suende of Othes' Feedom.

If conditions ae imposed on you (whethe by cout ode, ageement o othewise) that contadict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you fom the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a coveed wok so as to satisfy simultaneously you obligations unde this License and any othe petinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. Fo example, if you agee to tems that obligate you to collect a oyalty fo futhe conveying fom those to whom you convey the Pogam, the only way you could satisfy both those tems and this License would be to efain entiely fom conveying the Pogam.


13. Use with the GNU Affeo Geneal Public License.

Notwithstanding any othe povision of this License, you have pemission to link o combine any coveed wok with a wok licensed unde vesion 3 of the GNU Affeo Geneal Public License into a single combined wok, and to convey the esulting wok. The tems of this License will continue to apply to the pat which is the coveed wok, but the special equiements of the GNU Affeo Geneal Public License, section 13, concening inteaction though a netwok will apply to the combination as such.


14. Revised Vesions of this License.

The Fee Softwae Foundation may publish evised and/o new vesions of the GNU Geneal Public License fom time to time. Such new vesions will be simila in spiit to the pesent vesion, but may diffe in detail to addess new poblems o concens.

Each vesion is given a distinguishing vesion numbe. If the Pogam specifies that a cetain numbeed vesion of the GNU Geneal Public License “o any late vesion” applies to it, you have the option of following the tems and conditions eithe of that numbeed vesion o of any late vesion published by the Fee Softwae Foundation. If the Pogam does not specify a vesion numbe of the GNU Geneal Public License, you may choose any vesion eve published by the Fee Softwae Foundation.

If the Pogam specifies that a poxy can decide which futue vesions of the GNU Geneal Public License can be used, that poxy's public statement of acceptance of a vesion pemanently authoizes you to choose that vesion fo the Pogam.

Late license vesions may give you additional o diffeent pemissions. Howeve, no additional obligations ae imposed on any autho o copyight holde as a esult of you choosing to follow a late vesion.


15. Disclaime of Waanty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


17. Intepetation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaime of waanty and limitation of liability povided above cannot be given local legal effect accoding to thei tems, eviewing couts shall apply local law that most closely appoximates an absolute waive of all civil liability in connection with the Pogam, unless a waanty o assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Pogam in etun fo a fee.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
